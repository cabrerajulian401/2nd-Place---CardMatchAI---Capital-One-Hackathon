# Credit Card Recommendation System - Presentation Script

## Slide 1: Tech Stack (20 seconds)

**Opening (5 seconds):**
"Today I'm presenting a sophisticated credit card recommendation system built with cutting-edge technologies."

**Tech Stack Overview (15 seconds):**
"Our solution leverages a modern, full-stack architecture. The frontend is built with React and JavaScript, providing an intuitive user interface. The backend uses FastAPI, a high-performance Python framework, ensuring rapid API responses. The core intelligence comes from LangGraph, which orchestrates our multi-agent AI system. And of course, we're using Python throughout for data processing and AI integration."

## Slide 2: System Architecture (30-45 seconds)

**Introduction (5 seconds):**
"Here's how our system works - it's a parallel multi-agent LLM solution designed to handle large context from our secure database."

**User Journey (10 seconds):**
"The process starts when a user submits their financial profile through our React frontend. This query flows through our FastAPI backend, which creates a session and processes the conversation. The LangGraph orchestrator then manages the entire workflow."

**Database & Distribution (10 seconds):**
"Our system connects to a secure JSON database containing credit card information from 15 trusted banking companies. The data pipeline distributes 80 cards across three parallel sub-agents, each handling 33% of the cards using GPT-3.5-turbo for analysis."

**AI Processing & Final Selection (10 seconds):**
"Each sub-agent filters the cards down to 15-20 recommendations. These then flow into our final card selection tool, which uses advanced LLM processing to narrow down to the top 3 cards. The results are parsed using regular expressions and returned as structured JSON to the frontend."

**Key Benefits (5 seconds):**
"This architecture ensures scalability, accuracy, and personalized recommendations based on real user data and preferences."
